# Photo Refiner extension for [A1111 WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) / [Forge WebUI](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge)
A simple script that allows you to give an extra touch of quality to the generations, adding various filters and photographic effects capable of making the images cooler. Enjoy üëç

### Available effects:

- Blur
- Sharp
- Chromatic Aberration
- Stauration
- Contrast
- Brightness
- Highlights
- Shadows
- Temperature
- Filmic Grain
- (EXPERIMENTAL) Face Enhancer - I added this function only because, as a ReActor user, I noticed that very often the face of the resulting images is slightly more "blurred" than the rest of the image, so thanks to this slider, it is possible to add a bit of sharpness only in the facial area, in order to make everything more homogeneous.
