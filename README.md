# Photo Refiner extension for [AUTOMATIC1111 WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
A simple script that allows you to give an extra touch of quality to the generations, adding various filters and photographic effects capable of making the images cooler.

To use it, simply select it from the list of scripts at the bottom of the WebUI and combine the various effects as you like.
In theory the script should intervene as the last generation step, so extensions like ADetailer and similar are 100% compatible.
Enjoy!
