- [(EXPERIMENTAL) Face Enhancer](https://i.imgur.com/BH5VWqZ.png) - I added this function only because, as a ReActor user, I noticed that very often the face of the resulting images is slightly more "blurred" than the rest of the image, so thanks to this slider, it is possible to add a bit of sharpness only in the facial area, in order to make everything more homogeneous.
